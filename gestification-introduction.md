JavaScript web-apps from Jaanga for the awesome [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) device.

Gestification has lots of live demos that all run in your browser. Just click and go. It's as easy as watching TV.

And each app has source code available under the do-what-you-pleases [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

Here's the thing:

Actually you have arrived at TWO places.

One place is the _browse the apps_ place. This is at the web address that begins: [jaanga.github.io](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification).

And the other place is the _browse the source code_ place. This at the web address that begins: [github.com/jaanga](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/blob/gh-pages/gestification-introduction.md).

Look at both places.

Welcome back from the dark side.

Now, here, there are four folders with code examples you can run, view or even edit.

The **'[Cookbook](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook)'** folder contains a number of short, simple apps that you coud use to build bigger apps. Files are generally about 200 or so lines of code.

The **'[Projects](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects)'** folder contains work that probably has start and finish dates and tends to be more complicated stuff.

The **'[Events Timely Things](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/events-timely)'** folder contains work prepared for an event, as a one-off probablt to help somebody or to respond to a specific query, or work that has been superseded such as fun home page graphics.

The **'[Work-in-Hand](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand)'** folder contains more experimental work where the final outcome is more up in the air.

The TL;DR is<!-- , <bdo dir="rtl" title='The BDO tag is a barrel of monkeys fun!' >hello</bdo>, --> just go to the [first one]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/index.html).
