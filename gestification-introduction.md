<!--
JavaScript web-apps from Jaanga for the awesome [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) device.
-->

Gestification has lots of live demos that all run in your browser. Just click and go. It's as easy as watching TV.

And each app has source code available under the do-what-pleases-you MIT License.

Here's the thing:

Actually there are two places.

One place is the _play with the apps_ place. 

And the other is the _read the source code_ place.

Which place are you in right now?

Actually, it's not easy to know the answer as both places are GitHub places.

And one place may be the evil twin of the other.

If you mostly see white, then you are in the _play with the apps_  place. To go to the other place click here.

If you scroll up to the top and you see the Octokitty icon then you are in the _read the source code_ place.  To go to the other place click [here](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/).

And, if you see lots of advertising then you may be in one of those sites that pilfers content. To go to the other place you can clickety-click-click.

Welcome back from the dark side.

Now, here, there are three sections you can visit.


The **'[cookbook](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook)'** folder contains a number of short, simple apps that you coud use to build bigger apps. Files are generally about 200 or so lines of code.

The **'[projects](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects)'** folder contains work that probably has start and finish dates and tends to be more complicated stuff.

The **'[work-in-hand](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand)'** folder contains more experimental work where the final outcome is more up in the air.

The TL;DR is, <bdo dir="rtl" title='The BDO tag is a barrel of monkeys fun!' >hello</bdo>, just go to the first one.
