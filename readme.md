Gestification Read Me
=====================

This repository contains numerous cookbook code exampples for apps that access the Leap Motion device 
and display data received fron the device in some 3d fashion using the Three.js JavaScript libry.

All the apps here are built with the help of [Leap.js](http://js.leapmotion.com/) and [Three.js](http://threejs.org).

The mission is to build apps that are 3D in every aspect - all interaction, movement is inworld 3D in your browser. 

With all of the apps in this repository, notice that your pointer or hands will get bigger and smaller as you move them in and out of the screen. 
You can move your pointer around, behind and under things. 
This is the sort of behavior you see in computer games that cost millions to produce. 
But it is not the sort of behavior that you typically find in simple, free open-source code.

The tools and designs for this sort of work are still at a very early stage of development.

The **'[cookbook](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook)'** folder contains a number of short, simple apps that you coud use to build bigger apps. Files are generally about 200 or so lines of code.

The **'[projects](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects)'** folder contains work that probably has start and finish dates and tends to be more complicated stuff.

The **'[work-in-hand](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/events-timely)'** folder contains code prepared for an event, as a one-off probablt to help somebody or to respond to a specific query, or work that has been superseded such as fun home page graphics..

The **'[work-in-hand](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand)'** folder contains more experimental work where the final outcome is more up in the air.

If you do not have the Leap Motion device, but you want to see what the demos look like, try this file: <http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/no-leap-view-only.html>

### Featured Apps

Release 7 of the project to build a working, usable skin and bones framework for the Leap Motion device.

R7 is the first revision that is not that bad.
