Gestification Read Me
=====================

This repository contains numerous cookbook code examples for apps that access the [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) device 
and display data received from the device in some 3D fashion with the help of [Leap.js](http://js.leapmotion.com/) and [Three.js](http://threejs.org).

## Notes

The mission is to build apps that are 3D in every aspect - all interaction, movement is inworld 3D in your browser. 

With all of the apps in this repository, notice that your pointer or hands will get bigger and smaller as you move them in and out of the screen. 
You can move your pointer around, behind and under things. 
This is the sort of behavior you see in computer games that cost millions to produce. 
But it is not the sort of behavior that you typically find in simple, free open-source code that runs in your browser.
The site is part of the process that will change the rules of the games. 

The tools and designs for this sort of work are, however, still at a very early stage of development.

## Content
The contents include:

* The **'[cookbook](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook)'** folder contains a number of short, simple apps that you could use to build bigger apps. Files are generally about 200 or so lines of code.

* The **'[projects](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects)'** folder contains work that probably has start and finish dates and tends to be more complicated stuff.

* The **'[Events - Timely Things](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/events-timely)'** folder contains code prepared for an event, as a one-off probably to help somebody or to respond to a specific query, or work that has been superseded such as fun home page graphics..

* The **'[work-in-hand](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand)'** folder contains more experimental work where the final outcome is more up in the air.

## Directions

_2013-11-07 ~ very first draft_

### New Forms of Communication
See airDoodle

### Appendage Simulation

See airHand

Creating tools that hlp generated realistic looking hands, claws or appendages whose movements may be ispayed in 3D in rel-time, recorded for later use 
or used in conjunction with other character animation tools and processes .

### Guidance Controls
Creating tools that allow you to navigate through 3D spaces using the motion of hands. 
Steering wheels, tillers and rudders, joy sticks and consoles all come to mind as existing methods.
Now that there is a device that allows the full six degrees of freddom, what new paradigms will be craeted?

### Games
Simulation and reality...


### Not Do list
Probably less work on gestures and tools that require a large corpora of data


<!--
If you do not have the Leap Motion device, but you want to see what the demos look like, try this file: <http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/no-leap-view-only.html>


### Featured Apps

Release 7 of the project to build a working, usable skin and bones framework for the Leap Motion device.

[Phalanges](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/phalanges/r7/phalanges.html)

R7 is the first revision that is not that bad.
