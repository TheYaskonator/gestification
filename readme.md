You have a [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) device.  

You're looking for cool apps with lots of JavaScript source code.  

<b style="color:red">&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;Bingo!!!</b>

You've arrived at a good place.

<!--
JavaScript web-apps from Jaanga for the awesome [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) device.
-->

Gestification has lots of live demos that all run in your browser. Just click and go. It's as easy as watching TV.

And each app has source code available under the do-what-pleases-you MIT License.

###Featured Apps

Release 7 of the project to build a working, usable skin and bones framework for the Leap Motion device.

[Phalanges](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/phalanges/r7/phalanges.html)

R7 is the first revision that is not that bad.

***

All the apps here are built with the help of [Leap.js](http://js.leapmotion.com/) and [Three.js](http://threejs.org).

The mission is to build apps that are 3D in every aspect - all interaction, movement is inworld 3D in your browser. 
The tools and designs for this sort of work are still at a very early stage of development.

With all of the apps in this repo, notice that your pointer or hands will get bigger and smaller as you move them in and out of the screen. You can move your pointer around, behind and under things. 
This is the sort of behavior you see in computer games that cost millions to produce. But it is not the sort of behavior that you typically find in simple, free open-source code.

The **'[cookbook](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook)'** folder contains a number of short, simple apps that you coud use to build bigger apps. Files are generally about 200 or so lines of code.

The **'[projects](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects)'** folder contains work that probably has start and finish dates and tends to be more complicated stuff.

The **'[work-in-hand](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand)'** folder contains more experimental work where the final outcome is more up in the air.

If you do not have the Leap Motion device, but you want to see what the demos look like, try this file: <http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/no-leap-view-only.html>
