airDoodle
=========

Live Demo: http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/projects/air-doodle/index.html

<p>airDoodle is what happens when the whitespace behind a web page is filled with a real-time animated 3D object.

These objects do not distract. airDoodles appear only when you want them to appear.

Who loves it when people want things to appear? Teachers, advertisers and search engines...

An AirDoodle:

* Does not interfere with regular content
* Only appears when you want it to appear
* Only loads well if you have the appropriate hardware
* And you really want the airDoodle to appear - even if only for a brief moment - because you have not seen what\'s there yet...
