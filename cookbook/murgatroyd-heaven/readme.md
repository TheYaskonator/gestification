### Description

See also [phrases:heavens-to-murgatroyd](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/heavens-to-murgatroyd.html)

Move hand in XYZ: moves the player sphere in XYZ  
Rotate hand: rotates the camera about the origin  
Cup hand: zooms the camera  

Every time the player-sphere encompasses a jewel, it transforms the jewel into a Murgatroyd.  
But if you don't move fast enough the jewel will transform back again.  
How many Murgatroyds can you create?  

PS Motion control is very quick and dirty, but all-in-all it was very easy to get out this first code
