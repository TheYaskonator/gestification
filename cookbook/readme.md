Cookbook
========

Cookbook code is an example of programming code that identifies or demonstrates a particular or specific aspect of a library or toolkit.

* [Boilerplate](./boilerplate) - A starting-off point file that loads the Three.js and Leap libraries and creates a simple 3D display of hands and pointables. 
* [Draw 3D Objects](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/draw-3d-objects) - 3D printing without a printer. Could be significant - one day.
* [Gesture Tally](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/gesture-tally) - See the swipes. Response to LM forum question. Code example.
* [Handy Videos](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/handy-videos) ~ Not your mother's video. Somewhat insane.
* [jestPlay](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/jest-play) - Record and replay Leap Motion JSON and BVH data capture. 
Much effort here - but not quite ready for prime time.
* [Leap Distance vs Normal](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/leap-distance-vs-normal) - another pitch, roll and yaw issues demo
* [Phalanges](./phalanges) - Now at R7. Base code for showing hand and fingers even when data is not available from the Leap device. Much effort here.
* [Murgatroyd Heaven](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/murgatroyd-heaven) - not an easy game. Early work.
* [Pitch Roll and Yaw](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/pitch-roll-yaw) - pitch, roll and yaw issues demo. Code example.
* [Pointing or Not](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/pointing-or-not/r1/pointing-or-not.html) - Are you pointing your finger? Code example.
* [Show of Hands](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/show-of-hands) - Use one hand to display seven hands. The prettiest app?
* [Touchly](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/touchly) ~ A bubble-pooping-like game. Fun.
* [youGest](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/yougest) - The ultimate Leap Motion data explorer. Much effort here.
