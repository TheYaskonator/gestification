jestPlay - Save & Read Leap Motion JSON Files
=============================================

Demo: http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/save-read-json/r1/save-read-json.html

The jestPlay app enables you to record your hand movements by saving data from the [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) device to your computer as JSON files. 
Once saved, you can read these files and watch a full 3D replay of the movements.

The app is a 'cookbook' style app. It is not a fully-featured or even a finished app. 
It does, however, provide you with a simple working example in under two hundred lines of code 
that you can use to start developing your own code.

The app provides full access to your operating systems file save and file open dialog boxes 
- which are features not normally found in JavaScript as they were introduced in HTML 5.

Based on the [Three.js](http://threejs.org) library, the app allows you to zoom, pan and and rotate the views of the replays.

This app supersedes 'save-json'.
