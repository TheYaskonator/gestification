Draw 3D Objects
===============

Live demo: http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/draw-3d-objects/r1/draw-3d-objects.html

It's something like 3D printing in thin air.

This is a vector paint app. You will see that the ojects created have shadows and that using your mouse you can zoom, pand and rotate all around the objects.

The app draws objects when you point with just one finger. The app stops drawing whenever you open your hand or make a fist.

You can choose to create tetrahedrons, cubes or spheres. You can select one of three sizes. Colors are randomly selected each time a fresh line is started.

###Road Map###
It's likely that this app will have many 'cousins' - apps that concentrate on particular aspects of drawing in 3D. 
Ultimately a much bigger app with combine these coding examples into a much complex feature example app.

###Issues###
The determination of whether a finger is being pointed or not is still at quite an early stage. 
The app frequently considers that you have two fingers displayed when you actually have only one displayed.
