Draw 3D Objects Read Me
=======================

Cropped iframe view of Draw 3D Objects:
<iframe src=draw-3d-objects/r2/draw-3d-objects.html width=96% height=300px style=margin:2% ></iframe>
Draws objects in 3D when you point and move a single finger.

### Live Demos 

[Draw 3D Objects R2](http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/draw-3d-objects/r2/draw-3d-objects.html)   

* Added save file. The app now can write out an HTML file that rebuilds whatever you created. Leap motion device not required. 
Files may be shared with anybody.

### Description

This is a vector paint app. You will see that the objects created have shadows and that using your mouse you can zoom, and and rotate all around the objects.

The app draws objects when you point with just one finger. The app stops drawing whenever you open your hand or make a fist.

You can choose to create tetrahedrons, cubes or spheres. You can select one of three sizes. Colors are randomly selected each time a fresh line is started.

### Road Map
It's likely that this app will have many 'cousins' - apps that concentrate on particular aspects of drawing in 3D. 
Ultimately a much bigger app will combine these coding examples into a much more complex feature example app.


### Issues
The determination of whether a finger is being pointed or not is still at quite an early stage. 
The app frequently considers that you have two fingers displayed when you actually have only one displayed.
