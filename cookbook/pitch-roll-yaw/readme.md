Pitch Roll & Yaw
================

Demo: http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/pitch-roll-yaw/r1/pitch-roll-yaw.html

Compares Pitch roll and yaw obtained from Leap Motion device.

Left Side uses Three.js lookAt & rotateOnAxis to rotate the palm

Right side uses pure JavaScript. The right side is jumpy and generally has more issues than the left side.

As of this writing, I have not been able to find a good way of displaying pitch, roll and yaw and am looking for help in finding better answers.
