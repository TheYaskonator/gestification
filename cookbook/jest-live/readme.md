Real-time Leap and bones.


### Live Demo

[jestLive]( http://jaanga.github.io/gestification/cookbook/jest-live/r1/jest-live.html)

### Description

jestLive recreates the real-time motions of hands and fingers as 3D objects in the display. 
You may select from several choices which type of hand you would like to see.
At any time you can use your pointing device to zoom, pan or orbit the view.

The jestLive app translates Leap Motion data into a character animation industry-standard BVH format.
The [BVH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biovision_Hierarchy) data is used to build and update objects (or 'bones') using Three.js.
