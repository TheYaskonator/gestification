###Road Map###
Better handling of gestures ~ first thing: define what 'better handling' means. ;-)  
Save and replay JSON data using normal OS file dialog boxes  
Export motion data as BVH files  
Display the data that relates to the Frame object  
Fingers have the correct roll  
Total hand has better display of motion  
Palm does display gymbol lock issues  
Provide 'in-world' objects to touch and manipulate  
Provide a mesh that looks like a hand that overlays the 'bones'  
Have that mesh animate in unison with the bones  
Bones change color in relation to their velocity in a visible and useful manner
