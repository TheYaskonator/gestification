The apps in this folder is stuff that works - after a fashion - but which could use a lot more effort.


[Draw 3D](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/draw-3d) 
- Draw obejtcs in 3D - vector objects that cast shadows and have editable data.
Ultimately these may well be the most impotant apps here.
But, for now, just a rough start.

[Hand 2 Go](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/hand2go) 
- infinitely extendible 3D landscape. Use your hand to travel through the countryside. 
Very much a work in progress, but this code will be very useful to game design.

[Hold 'Em](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/holdem) 
- An early attempt at building user interface elements for the Leap Motion device. 

[Motion Device Detector](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/motion-device-detector)
- part of a Stackoverflow discussion to ascertain if there is an easy and reliable method for determing if a Leap Motion device is connected.
Dimitry and my conclusions: there is not.

[Phalanges](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/phalanges)
- **The app of the moment** Can you create a realtime, 3D skin and bones character elements using a Leap Motion device.
Not yet, but perhaps soon...
