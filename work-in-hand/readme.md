Work-In-Hand
============

_This folder does not yet have an HTML web page._  



The apps in this folder are things that work - after a fashion - but which could use a lot more effort.

[**Phalanges**](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/phalanges)  
- This location deprecated. Please see (https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/phalanges)  
- Is it posible to create a realtime, 3D skin and bones character elements using a Leap Motion device? Not yet, but perhaps soon...


[**Hand 2 Go**](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/hand2go)  
- infinitely extendible 3D landscape. Use your hand to travel through the countryside. 
Very much a work in progress, but this code will be very useful to game design.

[**Hold 'Em**](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/holdem)  
- An early attempt at building user interface elements for the Leap Motion device. 

[**Motion Device Detector**](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/motion-device-detector) 
- part of a Stackoverflow discussion to ascertain if there is an easy and reliable method for determing if a Leap Motion device is connected.
Dimitry and my conclusions: there is not.


[**Save JSON**](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/save-json)    
- Deprecated. See the newer [jestPlay](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/jest-play).

[**Draw 3D**](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/draw-3d)  
- Deprecated. See https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/draw-3d-objects
- Draw objects in 3D - vector objects that cast shadows and have editable data.
Ultimately these may well be the most impotant apps here.
But, for now, just a rough start.
