### [Motion Device Detector](https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/work-in-hand/motion-device-detector) 

- Original code forked from Mr.doob's detector.js. Same idea - detect if there is a mmotion detection device available.
- Part of a Stackoverflow discussion to ascertain if there is an easy and reliable method for determing if a Leap Motion device is connected.
- Dimitry and my conclusions: there is not.
